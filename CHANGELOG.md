## V2.0.2 - 2020-6-21

### Added

- cleaned up pending refresh logic and refresh on demand if needed, at most every 15 seconds for now

## V2.0.1 - 2020-6-21

### Fixed

- pass value to the CharacteristicSetCallback callback

## V2.0.0 - 2020-6-21 (MAJOR RELEASE)

### Added

- rewrite in Typescript to provide much cleaner/safer base
- minimum of Homebridge 1.1.1 is required
- support DynamicPlatformPlugin
- properly add/remove/update cached accessories on startup

### Fixed

- caching/persisting of accessories, so if bridge is unavailable when server starts the previous configured shades will remain

- add retry logic for obtaining the initial config from the controller if there is an error contacting it

- try to cleanup the way I was setting/getting/updating of service characteristics to be more proper

## V1.4.3 - 2020-6-19

### Fixed

- cleanup error logging so errors aren't logged in three different places

## V1.4.2 - 2020-5-17

### Fixed

- really fix issue #5 (off by one error)

## V1.4.1 - 2020-5-17

### Fixed

- Fixed issue #5, don't create a virtual room blind if there is only a single blind in the room.

- prettier formatting from previous pull request

## V1.4.0 - 2020-4-29

### Added

- `"topDownBottomUpBehavior"` Choose the desired behavior for Top-Down / Bottom-Up blinds. If `"topDown"` is specified, the slider will control the middle rail, and the blind will open downward. If `"bottomUp"` is specified, the slider will control the bottom rail, and the blind will open upward. Default is `"topDown"`. This setting has no effect on standard blinds (i.e., blinds with only "Bottom-Up" functionality).

## V1.3.0 - 2020-4-29

### Added

- `"setPositionThrottleRateMsecs"` rate limits how often we send set position commands to the gateway. Default is 5000 msecs.

## V1.2.3 - 2020-4-19

### Fixed

- sigh. need to read first line to make set work. log warning if it isn't what we expected

## V1.2.2 - 2020-4-19

### Fixed

- raise socket timeout back to from 30s

## V1.2.1 - 2020-4-19

### Fixed

- don't throw an error if the first line we read isn't `HunterDouglas Shade Controller`

- lower socket timeout from 30s to 15s

- don't add pollingInterval to backoff when retrying so we retry quicker on errors

- set max backoff to pollingInterval instead of pollingInterval\*20

## V1.2.0 - 2020-4-18

### Fixed

- make sure to call `connection.close()` in async convenience functions

- finally (hopefully) fix #1. Since we are using a shared Promise, make sure to have a `.catch` handler when also setting up the `.finally`

## V1.1.9 - 2020-4-11

### Fixed

- call `socket.destroy()` instead of `socket.end()`

- wrap `_pollForStatus` in a domain to see if unhandled error/exception is at the root cause of the crashing

## V1.1.8 - 2020-4-9

### Fixed

- replace `throw new BridgeError` with `this.emit('error', ...)` when handling unexpected hello response

- call `socket.end()` before emitting an error in `_handleError` (just in case)

### Added

- dump out read lines when debug is on

## V1.1.7 - 2020-1-19

### Fixed

- `_updateAccessories` `status` is null when there is an error, so add instanceof check

## V1.1.6 - 2020-1-17

### Fixed

- change `.once('error')` to `.on('error')`, otherwise if multiple errors are emitted the second one will crash node as an unhandled error

- don't start polling if no accessories are found

## V1.1.5 - 2020-1-14

### Fixed

- shouldnâ€™t need to block during pending set

- set `Characteristic.PositionState` to `PositionState.STOPPED`

## V1.1.4 - 2020-1-12

### Fixed

- have `_command` use `_readUntil` which pull lines from buffer first instead of returning each buffered line via async

## V1.1.3 - 2020-1-12

### Added

- config `"visibleBlindNames"` Comma-seperated list of blind names (prefixed with room name) to make visible. All other blinds are ignored. Only used when `createDiscreteBlinds` is true.

- use the average of all blind positions in the room for the value of the virtual room
  blind

### Fixed

- don't log at info level in BlindAccessory

## V1.1.2 - 2020-1-12

### Fixed

- pass in log to Controller constructor

## V1.1.1 - 2020-1-12

### Fixed

- properly apply default values from config

## V1.1.0 - 2020-1-12

### Added

- config `"createVirtualRoomBlind"` Creates a virtual blind for each room that contains all the blinds in the room. Default is true. Changing this blind will change all blinds in the room.

- config `"createDiscreteBlinds"` Creates a blind for each real blind. Default is true. You might want to turn this off if you want only the virtual room blind.

- config `"prefixRoomNameToBlindName"` Prefix the room name to each discrete blind name. Default is true.
